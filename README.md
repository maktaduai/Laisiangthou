Laisiangthou
==========

This is the source code for the Paite Android Laisiangthou, which means the Holy Bible in Paite. As the whole app itself is derived in part from open source codes, the Developer feels that the end product must also be made available as open source. Thus, the complete sourcecodes for Laisiangthou app is made available here.

Not Really A Bug But...
-------

<code>When loading the whole project into Android Studio, if a popup warning "...error on line 1 at .idea/workspace.xml" shows, then please go into the <a href="https://github.com/maktaduai/Laisiangthou/tree/master/.idea">.idea/</a> folder, delete workspace.xml and restart Android Studio. Don't worry. This will create a new and fixed workspace.xml file as soon as Android Studio is restarted and your project reloads. Kipak!</code>
